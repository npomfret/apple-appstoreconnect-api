# CI builds must start from a clean, empty checkout

Project: `apple-appstoreconnect-api`. Requested by Nick on 31 October 2026. Status: open.

Ensure every CI build starts from an empty source directory before checking out
the exact requested revision, unless a specific, justified exception is recorded.
Follow the [shared acceptance criteria](../../snowmonkey-proxy-common/tasks/2026-10-31-ci-clean-checkouts.md#shared-acceptance-criteria).

Local CI entry points found: `.teamcity`. Include server-managed builds and inherited templates in the inventory too.

- [ ] Inventory every CI build/leg and its checkout and output directories.
- [ ] Apply clean checkout isolation and explicit cache/artifact handling.
- [ ] Verify freshness and cleanup serially; record build IDs and evidence.
- [ ] Record each justified exception with its build/path, reason, retained
  state and freshness/isolation controls, or record why no exception is needed.

Keep paused builds paused. Creating this task does not change CI settings,
delete build data or claim the requirement is already satisfied.
